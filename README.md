# Football dataset

This repository contains data of football games played in different basketball leagues. The purpose of this dataset is to collect and organize
data of **high granularity** from football games.

This is an ongoing project. I will try to regularly fix the possible mistakes in the data,
update the datasets and increase the granularity of the data, if that is possible.

Directory [src/](src) contains the code that was used to **download**, **scrape**, **collect** and **edit** all the data. Directory [data/](data/) contains the available datasets.

Data is published in **CSV** format and is currently mantained for the following leagues:
* [Premier League](data/premier_league),
* [Bundesliga](data/bundesliga),
* [Ligue 1](data/ligue_1),
* [Serie A](data/serie_a),
* [La Liga](data/la_liga).

There is also some data available for the other competitions (see [data/](data/)), however it is not maintained and updated.
